@ah_shur_look_it @Ciaraioch @AgeAction @bealtaine Well if you’ve no interest in human rights and equality then I can do no more. You’ve no interest in understanding the issue just dissing me because I advocate for them.
@ah_shur_look_it @Ciaraioch @AgeAction @bealtaine I did answer your question I explained that she stereotyped on the basis of age that is ageism.

@CryptoBullRon I know. Our shop was an old thatch roof with 2 women about 50 yrs old. Of course they seemed 100 to me. They had this silver scoop that they’d use. My dad always wanted a quarter pound of clove drops that they scooped out with their hand into a brown paper bag. Bliss

"Re. UK newspaper thread yesterday about how “only” 50% of women under 30 have kids now compared to 86% of women in 1941. A gut punch reminder of the precarity of women’s lives. If they’d had choices in 1941, it’s likely similar droves of young women would’ve avoided motherhood."
@jamieklingler A bit late with my recommendation… but I loved “It’s Complicated” with Meryl Streep &amp; Alec Baldwin on @NetflixUK (it’s from 2009). The banter between the women at 50+ was much more natural than #AndJustLikeThat
"@Lotus_of_Honor @ArielleDundas But even so, women are half the population, so popular podcasts should be 50% women right? And famous YouTubers and streamers?"
"@coldhardfacts7 @shebahn @talkSPORT The days of when men get to tell women how to speak or to ""handle themselves"" is long gone.

"@arseblagger @Dazwint @Arsenal18862006 Bobby Gould, only joking, but before my time many would say Joe Baker, he never won anything with us but scored shit load of goals, oddly was sold to Forest aged 26
there has to be lots of legends from the barren years of the 50's &amp; 60's, maybe SuperMac in the 70's he won nothing"
