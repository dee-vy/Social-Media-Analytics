189,@WhatsOnStage @AnythingGUK @BarbicanCentre @RobertLindsay @garywilmotactor @CarlyMDyer @derekmclane @ConcordShows @HaydnOakley It’s all about opinions but how Sutton Foster wasn’t even nominated….well….just ridiculous tbh (with the greatest of respect) - was the performance of the year IMO 🤷‍♂️
190,"@WhatsOnStage @Rob_Madge_02 @TurbineTheatre @pippa_cleary @rdlaight @G_Reeve_Design @PaulTaylorMills Yesss! I nominated and voted for this!!! Hell yeah, go @Rob_Madge_02 🥳🥳"
191,"@WhatsOnStage I don’t even understand this quote? Is she trying to imply she’s plus size because she really isn’t. If that’s what she is saying, this comes across as pretty damaging for girls who look up to her who will go round thinking they’re also overweight now. Not a great example to set"

4118,"@Nicky_Rush_ @HairyMonkeyGor1 @WhatsOnStage Because when people decided to split gender and sex, they forgot to introduce new terminology for the genders. To avoid confusion, people often use male and female for the sexes. Unfortunately, some people have now started to use male and female for genders as well."
4119,@NathanielHart72 @HairyMonkeyGor1 @WhatsOnStage if they are biological terms for the two human sexes why re they not on any forms ever?
4120,"@Nicky_Rush_ @HairyMonkeyGor1 @WhatsOnStage Then you should brush up on your biology. Male and female are cross-species sex terms. Man and woman are the biological terms for the human sexes. We have different terms for the biological sexes of other anisogamous species, such as cow and bull."
4121,@NathanielHart72 @HairyMonkeyGor1 @WhatsOnStage i’ve only ever heard male and female for sex and gender. man and woman i’ve only heard in the context of gender
4122,"@Nicky_Rush_ @HairyMonkeyGor1 @WhatsOnStage Is it? Or is it a role for a male/female ""identifying"" actor/actress?"
4123,@NathanielHart72 @HairyMonkeyGor1 @WhatsOnStage it says “male/female identifying role” that language means “male/female identifying” is the adjective before the “role” noun.
4124,"@Nicky_Rush_ @HairyMonkeyGor1 @WhatsOnStage Sex isn't based on genitals. Man and woman are the biological terms for the two human sexes, and that's the basis of the separation of those loos in the first place."
4125,@Nicky_Rush_ @HairyMonkeyGor1 @WhatsOnStage Are they? I find that hard to read in the OP to be honest. It's very much unclear whether the male/female applies to the role or to the actor/actress.
4126,@NathanielHart72 @HairyMonkeyGor1 @WhatsOnStage my tweets only link to one person. it’s obvious if you click on the thread
4127,@NathanielHart72 @HairyMonkeyGor1 @WhatsOnStage then start petitioning for the renaming of ladies and gents to vulvas and penises. if you want loos genital based have that on the door. and get people to stop harassing others for being in the “wrong” loo.
4128,@NathanielHart72 @HairyMonkeyGor1 @WhatsOnStage the awards are separated based on character - whether it’s gender or sex i’m not entirely sure as there are no trans characters nominated. the language male/female identifying was added because trans and nonbinary actors have played cisgender characters and should be eligible
4129,"@Nicky_Rush_ @HairyMonkeyGor1 @WhatsOnStage Why? I agree with you that there's no reason whatsoever to separate them on the basis of gender, but there are plenty of reasons to separate them on the basis of sex."
4130,"@Nicky_Rush_ @HairyMonkeyGor1 @WhatsOnStage Please be specific then next time, and link the tweet in question. That makes it a lot easier to separate from all the other people in this thread who've told you you were wrong.

The big question is: are these awards supposed to be sex or gender separated, and why?"
4131,"@NathanielHart72 @HairyMonkeyGor1 @WhatsOnStage yeah sure. i don’t mind ladies loos either, they tend to be cleaner than the gents - but trans people have the right to go in the toilet of their GENDER, not their sex"
4132,@Nicky_Rush_ @HairyMonkeyGor1 @WhatsOnStage You don't think there's a need for separate communal loo areas? Practically no-one favors unisex loos; you're quite alone in that opinion I'm afraid.
4133,@NathanielHart72 @HairyMonkeyGor1 @WhatsOnStage the tweet that i responded to jesus christ. you clearly have SOME common sense so you know EXACTLY what i mean so can you not be pedantic for the sake of it??

4137,@NathanielHart72 @HairyMonkeyGor1 @WhatsOnStage should be allowed to use that one. that’s a gender-based right
4138,"@NathanielHart72 @HairyMonkeyGor1 @WhatsOnStage i don’t think they need to be at all. i would love combined loos, but they’re not separated by penis and vulva are they? they’re separated by “ladies” and “gentlemen”. so gentlemen (including trans gentlemen) should be allowed to use that one. ladies (including trans ladies)"

4140,@NathanielHart72 @HairyMonkeyGor1 @WhatsOnStage the original tweet was about GENDER and OP was questioning the language used because they seem to not understand the difference between the two
4141,"@NathanielHart72 @Nicky_Rush_ @WhatsOnStage Need an awful lot of loos….tetrisgender, catgender, hedgegender……"
4142,@Nicky_Rush_ @HairyMonkeyGor1 @WhatsOnStage Why would loos need to be separated on the basis of gender? That makes no sense whatsoever.
4143,@NathanielHart72 @HairyMonkeyGor1 @WhatsOnStage an example of sex based rights would be right to abortion. an example of gender based rights would be public loos. no one is trying to replace sex based rights with gender based rights because they’re ENTIRELY different things.
4144,@Nicky_Rush_ @HairyMonkeyGor1 @WhatsOnStage The binary of sex has nothing to do with transphobia. The validity of transgender people does not depend on the biological definition of sex.
4145,"@Nicky_Rush_ @HairyMonkeyGor1 @WhatsOnStage I don't think that's the issue. The issue is that some people want to replace sex based rights with gender based rights, and refuse to consider the consequences of such an action. In the process, they're trying to erase the concept of biological sex."
4146,@NathanielHart72 @HairyMonkeyGor1 @WhatsOnStage google is free for OP to use. i’m done seeing transphobia in my replies. go and educate yourself
4147,@NathanielHart72 @HairyMonkeyGor1 @WhatsOnStage the point still stands that sex and gender are completely different things and the theatre community should be more inclusive and accepting of people different from them
4148,"@Nicky_Rush_ @HairyMonkeyGor1 @WhatsOnStage No, you got that from an online blog post actually. I'm not making any claims with regards to gender here; I'm merely explaining that sex in anisogamous species, from plants, to birds, to reptiles, to fish, to mammals, including humans, is binary: two sexes: male and female."
4149,@NathanielHart72 @HairyMonkeyGor1 @WhatsOnStage i got that based off a scientific study that listed those as classified sexes in humans. gender is still different and i would hope the theatre community would be more accepting of people who are different from them
4150,"@Nicky_Rush_ @HairyMonkeyGor1 @WhatsOnStage We're talking about humans here of course. Sex in many reptiles for example is determined by temperature, but still defined by gametes."
4151,"@Nicky_Rush_ @HairyMonkeyGor1 @WhatsOnStage Wrong. Sex is not based on chromosomes. Sex is determined by the genes on chromosomes, and defined by gametes. People with XO (Turner syndrome) for example are female, because they have the Müllerian reproductive phenotype for the production of large gametes."

5905,"@tony_gingell2 @TheStage @WhatsOnStage Hey Tony, a swing is generally someone who covers more than one track in a show. Usually the ensemble tracks. Owing to sickness or injury, swings perform different tracks. In the US, swings are highly respected and paid well, here not so much which is a shame (especially now)."

6403,"@eggsbened @MarkValencia @Sarahc_k @WhatsOnStage @Variety I totally was. Her performance is indelible in my memory &amp; coloured the way I view the part including Lisa Minelli.

6419,"@starofstage @ripx4nutmeg @sarahshoesey @AlexLukeWood @WhatsOnStage It’s a kick to long traditions of feminist theatre, transgressive performance, radical theatre, etc. Theatre that sought to liberate people from boxes created by oppressive regimes like the patriarchy.

6422,@LottieHistory @ripx4nutmeg @sarahshoesey @AlexLukeWood @WhatsOnStage These people have tied themselves up in knots... possibly up their own arseholes. I've worked in theatre for 40 years.

6648,@DickonFarmar @WhatsOnStage @sfosternyc @AnythingGUK Fair enough. But it does seem that missing out Sutton Foster — who won the Tony on Broadway — is an egregious omission.

9648,"@zoellaa19 do you not see the guy don’t hear them .. lol whats more likely . the girl is a crazy fan on stage or the girl is yelling about how some fans were killed by some other fans … ??? THE GUY JUST LIKE GET OFF THE STAGE I CANT HEAR U , u shouldn’t be up here ! bro use ya brain"
9649,"@victormayy @aholloway1300 @28louhaza @Wmnjeri @Drew_Chaiinz @alllove_here @sisihunni @trvisXX If any of this dead people was your family memeber you would say sh..t different . Security has contact with backstage people. They all knew whats going on inc him.  When Kim was robbed , Kanye was notified in seconds and walk away from the stage . Show cancelled"
9650,People shouldnt have to d*e before you stop the concert. You notice people collapsing and several medical vehicles in the crowd and you keep playing instead of helping to direct the crowd from the stage or even pause to go find out whats going on. Thats sellective ignorance! https://t.co/NG0LKgqcYA
9651,@Jess__Quinones @MycahABC13 Artists while on stage have no idea whats happening on a security level until they are told to stop performing
9652,"@caseysmulti @Diana_wastaken @bigbossboze He actually did pause when he noticed someone pass out and let them pull him out before starting again.

The show not stopping however isnt on him, when you have a crowd of 50 thousand its on the organizers not the guy on the stage who cant hear or see most of whats happening."
9653,@jksbambieyes_wa @stargirlmission @kvzpto @trvisXX omg 🙄 clearly u have no brain cells. shes tryna say that people can see whats happening in the audience when their on stage when in fact its very hard. you dont need to be someone that has been on stage to know that
9654,"teens, isn’t responsible for people drinking, the drugs, all thats a security and managements job. he has an ear piece in &amp; also from the stage + when performing it is hard to acknowledge whats going on. but there are lots of videos where he has stopped the show. and i even saw"
9655,"literally how could you stand up on a stage and SEE whats happening in a crowd and think, “yeah, performing my songs is way more important than helping the people who support me.” like HUH????"
9656,@JjCastro2345 @KingJoey06 @kittenpsychic @junofiles @MeatRub69 @xlvvvi @trvisXX Nothing. just thought since you wanna argue with a woman you should try arguing with a man. you never been on a stage and think he wouldnt know whats going on in a crowd even when flashing lights and people are screaming help. stop making excuses.
9657,nah cus i just went to a concert and the artist on that stage told us all in the pit to look out for eachother and help up the fallen. artists on stages can see whats going on. youd be safer at a deathmetal show than astroworld. https://t.co/Fuhaaym0Fb
9658,"Sucks to see @trvisXX getting a bad press for being a professional. Saw him perform with a blown out knee, he just hopped on 1 leg. how would he know whats going on in the audience from the stage,  all he knows is keep the show going. He would never know someone's sticking folks"
9659,but how tf do you not stop a show and CHECK to see whats going on when you can see the ambulance lights from your pov being on stage. they’re bright. in a crowd thats dark...
9660,@RichLux713 people wanna keep blaming travis scott but you gotta remember those people CHOSE to trample and act like fools and hurt other people. Its also so hard to know whats going on in a huge crowd like that especially from the stage. This is going to fall on the venue &amp; security
9661,@sewerdwxller not to defend his actions but its really hard to tell whats going on on stage. i dont think travis intentionally was letting people die. i really think he didnt understand the weight of the situation and it was a horrible mistake
9662,"@Issulf @fishinwmarshall @just9n if true, thats a bit different, but that stuff does happen alot at concerts and they rarely get stopped, so its possible he didnt realize the severity. Also, from the stage, its hard to tell whats actually going on. Until more info is out, I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt."
9663,"@MgMagician @S6_Broskiie @georgee36234860 @KEEMSTAR whats crazy is these people think they’re right by blaming travis. even if travis did stop like they said he should, who would even listen lmao and the fact that they’re mad he didnt stop the show cuz he saw people on the ground. How would a man on a stage see ppl on the floor."

9670,"@juanshere He def could have! But when your on stage with a bunch of lights at night its kinda hard to see exactly whats goin on in the crowd! He could have thought all the hands in the air and yellin was just fans screaming for him! ( just saying maybe, im not him i dont know what he saw)"
9671,they were literally parting the crowd and then diving/running into each other once the beat dropped &amp; thats when it really hit that i attend a pwi cause never in my life 😭 lol i had to go home ask whats a mosh pit after hearing swae lee say it on stage.

Consigning you to Room 101.

12379,"@be63857868 @WhatsOnStage You are specifically encouraged to join in at both of those shows.

Again, respect for a medium.

Simple really.

You'll never get it though. 

It's the people around you who want to listen to the performers I feel sorry for. Hopefully I won't be one of them."
12380,"@be63857868 @WhatsOnStage It's a simple matter of respect. Respect for the performers, respect for those around you.  

Football was cited earlier; OK to sing as it doesn't affect what they're doing (&amp; cultural norm).  Your warbling at a show does.

If you want to sing, buy the soundtrack and sing along."

But much as I love the songs, I'm not signing along at a regular performance.  It's respect for the performers and those around me."
12392,"@KGemfeldt @WhatsOnStage If you sing (or talk, or get your phone out) you WILL disturb those around you.

And it is disrespectful to the performers who pour their heart and soul into what they do... for YOU.

13133,@Sarahc_k @WhatsOnStage It’s popular with so many children. I’ve taught many boys who loved wearing their Elsa dresses and a lot of boys will feel they can’t dress up as the princess because of the world we live in. Let’s not keep regurgitating outdated stereotypes. Thank you for amending.

13219,"@bekkiifennelly @HarrySims6 @SarcyMoo @TheWorstTom @OrlandoGriffoni @WhatsOnStage Yep - it's /surplus/ rather than profit (Most producing theatres run a non-charity production subsidiary that technically makes profit for tax purposes, but it's donated to the charity)

IMO, tho, any surplus at all generated by this production is a disgrace &amp; tix should be free"
13220,"@iamcactuscat @HarrySims6 @SarcyMoo @TheWorstTom @OrlandoGriffoni @WhatsOnStage Absolutely, but legally the won't be defined at 'profits' they'll be donations and fundraising efforts. If they're profits then they have to pay tax on it, whereas donations I don't believe they do. So they have to advertise it as such and usually will be voluntary."

13224,"@bekkiifennelly @HarrySims6 @SarcyMoo @TheWorstTom @OrlandoGriffoni @WhatsOnStage Even a NFP venue will aim for an annual budget that does better than break even, as the aim is to build up reserves.

13225,@bekkiifennelly @HarrySims6 @SarcyMoo @TheWorstTom @OrlandoGriffoni @WhatsOnStage Many productions at NFP theatres are *individually* targeted to do much better than break-even - the surplus generated underpins venue running costs - so this show could well do much better than wash its own face

13383,"@PrimeShade @LukeWorganTech @WhatsOnStage 1/DO - donate money, volunteer time/skills if possible, uplift and champion the people actually effected by Grenfell. Find ways to use your own power and privilege so that people can tell their own stories."
13384,"@TheatreSpoonie @DaisyMiggins @WhatsOnStage I don’t think there’s enough information on the piece yet to be able to tell whether it’s being done in poor taste, but to assume it’s for entertainment or that it’ll be a musical as someone said, is a reductive view which totally ignores the power of theatre to educate."
13385,"@TheatreSpoonie @DaisyMiggins @WhatsOnStage I’m sure your point is valid but you’ve linked to an article that I have to pay to read… 
I agree that the people affected should be involved. Though I very much doubt a verbatim piece on the inquiry has the sole purpose to entertain."
13386,"@DaisyMiggins @WhatsOnStage Years ago Tricycle Theatre was WAY ahead of media in presenting the Bloody Sunday enquiry, &amp; Stephen Lawrence enquiry on stage, so people could access &amp; critique what happened. They sifted a blizzard of info to sharpen minds on consequences/blame.  Don't dismiss this too quick."

13388,"@WhatsOnStage I hate these programmes/films/plays/musicals that cash in on someone else’s misery so soon afterwards, very bad taste."
13389,"@WhatsOnStage Not for profit doesn't mean they won't make money out of it, it just means the earnings will be totally swallowed up in paying the cost of running it.....hmm bad taste methinks."
13390,@WhatsOnStage Wtf? 😳
13391,@hermionerxse @DaisyMiggins @WhatsOnStage This one is being done for entertainment. And it is being put on without any actual input from those affected. It is a whitewashing of the tragedy from a theatre that has caused direct harm to their local BAME community. Theatre doesn't happen in a vaccum. https://t.co/hurOm4PG5v
13392,@HarrySims6 @SarcyMoo @TheWorstTom @OrlandoGriffoni @WhatsOnStage Surely not-for-profit means it'll be priced to break even? Saying 'profits go to xyz' means that they are planning on making profit. It just isn't going into the creators pockets.
13393,@PrimeShade @WhatsOnStage This is being made as entertainment. There is no mention of how this production is working with or support those who survived the fire. The production is very white and posh and the company producing it has destroyed the trust with marginalised people with previous shows.
13394,"@LukeWorganTech @WhatsOnStage I gather it's based on the inquiry, and will presumably reflect the ethnicity of the panel and expert witnesses. 

A good way for ""wealthy white people"" to ignore the victims' voices would be not to tackle the subject at all and just put on yet another feelgood jukebox musical."
13395,@bekkiifennelly @SarcyMoo @TheWorstTom @OrlandoGriffoni @WhatsOnStage No surely it means it isnt being done for profit? There will still be money
13396,@WhatsOnStage Such a wretched country
13397,"@PrimeShade @WhatsOnStage Well the cast mentioned in the article is entirely white, as are almost all the designers etc. Wealthy white people using the trauma and suffering of poor predominately people of colour whilst seemingly ignoring their voices. It’s pretty fucking gross."
13398,@SarcyMoo @TheWorstTom @OrlandoGriffoni @WhatsOnStage If it's not-for-profit then there aren't any profits to go to anyone.

13403,@iyce_iyce_baby @WhatsOnStage So gross. How does this shit get funded.
13404,@WhatsOnStage Are they ok
13405,@TheWorstTom @OrlandoGriffoni @WhatsOnStage Where are profits going? Victims? Who knows ...
13406,"@DaisyMiggins @WhatsOnStage Theatre isn’t all about entertainment. A lot of the time it’s used to shine a light on injustice, educate people and tell difficult stories. This is no different to a documentary other than it’ll be live rather than filmed for TV."
13407,"@WhatsOnStage I understand the sensitivity here but I honestly don't see how this is more offensive than the various productions about Hillsborough, 9/11 and practically every other major tragedy anyone can think of. 

Drama isn't always about entertainment, nor should it be."

13411,@KateMaffin @ThatBurkeBarry @WhatsOnStage @JimMFelton Considering the Government haven't helped the theatres during the pandemic.
13412,"@ThatBurkeBarry @StormyT06260730 @WhatsOnStage @JimMFelton With the greatest of respects, I’m not sure we need theatre to expose our current governments corruption 😞"
13413,"@KateMaffin @StormyT06260730 @WhatsOnStage No it isn't. Theatre has long been used as an effective platform to expose corruption, injustice and other failings in society.

BTW, you possibly got the impression it was a musical from @JimMFelton who tweeted this to make a point satirically."
13414,"@WhatsOnStage ‘After suffering a global pandemic, with attendance dropping well before COVID hit, what the West End really needs is an overpriced performance patronised by those living in the London Bubble but totally untouched by the subjects raised in the play they were watching’"
13415,"Thousands more seats have been released for Cabaret in the West End!

13416,@WhatsOnStage Ghouls
13417,"@WhatsOnStage This is just so many kinds of wrong. It's less than five years since the fire, how can you even think of making some kind of 'entertainment' out of it?
I hope it never makes any stage."
13418,@WhatsOnStage I prefer musical about Tory corruption.
13419,@kaceyainsworth @WhatsOnStage @marsdoug @StewClarke @ela_lisondra @SophieWojna @chris_tendai @andrerefig @SallyFrith @tomscuttdesign Agree can't wait to watch it x
13420,@WhatsOnStage Has anyone else looked at that cast list? Every actor I googled was white...
13421,"@StormyT06260730 @WhatsOnStage You’re right, I’m not sure where I plucked musical from, but still.. it’s very bad taste isn’t it."
13422,@KateMaffin @WhatsOnStage It's a play not a musical but I get what you mean.
13423,@BrettBartMuse @erinotoole Whats your point? There is no comparison with Donald Trump .typical Liberal hysteria on conservatism..let Trudeau bring this country to bankruptcy..we are already not taken seriously on the world stage under his failed leadership.
13424,"@WhatsOnStage So...focus the play on the victims' stories right, not just the white folks ""in charge"", because that would be a horrible whitewash making the Grenfell residents victims all over again. Is this art or racism?"
13425,"@WhatsOnStage The current Britain we live in...

Grenfell - The Musical &gt;&gt; Grenfell - Justice"
13426,"@WhatsOnStage I dunno guys, don’t you think we should wait for the Grenfell residents to get justice first, before we make a musical from their trauma?"
13427,@WhatsOnStage This is a wind up yea? Such bad taste
13428,@WhatsOnStage WTF
13429,@WhatsOnStage This is in VERY BAD TASTE.

13435,@WhatsOnStage YOUR FUCKING KIDDING ME???
13436,"@OrlandoGriffoni @WhatsOnStage I had the same initial reaction but article does say at the bottom it's a not-for-profit play.
Still doesn't sit super well with me."
13437,@WhatsOnStage Just vile! Everyone involved should be ashamed.
13438,"@WhatsOnStage So like, ALL the profits from this play are going to the parties affected by the fire, RIGHT? Someone running this sees that's the ONLY option, right?"
13439,@WhatsOnStage what the fuck is this???
13440,@WhatsOnStage Is there anything to be said for saying another Mass?
13441,"@WhatsOnStage This is all kinds of f*cked up, whoever's idea this is needs to have a word with themselves!"
