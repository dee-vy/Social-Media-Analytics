Plus, UK sets operate on different freqs to the US, whom changed freqs to avoid suspected harm to sea life. If you want to ban warships from using Sonar in the Irish EEZ? Leave the NATO PFP &amp; EAPC"
574,"@ding__dong_____ @donna_cooney1 @Rus_Emb_Ireland @simoncoveney @rtenews @dfatirl @IrishTimes @Independent_ie @irishexaminer @cnnbrk Again, most sonar that is used is passive. It's rare as hens teeth that the likes of a Type 23 will go active. Another reason they don't like going active is it lets any potential enemies know what frequencies you use. The vessels most using active sonar are the fishing fleet."
575,"@ding__dong_____ @donna_cooney1 @Rus_Emb_Ireland @simoncoveney @rtenews @dfatirl @IrishTimes @Independent_ie @irishexaminer @cnnbrk You mean like fishing vessels that use fish locators? Do you mean that type of active sonar? Just a quick heads up, the amount of time a submarine will use active sonar is as rare as hens teeth.  Submarines do not like to be detected, using active sonar is like shouting HERE I AM"
