16745,@KarenLisaWhite Another way to look at it‚Ä¶. is it more important for the younger generations to develop the habit of #LifelongLearning in order to succeed in a world where they probably won‚Äôt stay in the same job for decades.
16746,#LifelongLearning https://t.co/HUwoYHQvZi
16747,"A4 In order to remain committed to #lifelonglearning we need to create environments where #continuousimprovement is celebrated, where we value research and inquiry over having all the answers. We need to cultivate curiosity &amp; collaboration rather than competition and judement."
16748,@SACAPGrad_CL A5. That is a really good question to which I don't know the answer :-). Looking forward to hearing from those who do #LifelongLearning
16749,A5 #LifelongLearning is valued by all generations according to survey from UK govt but perception is that organisations favour it for different generations . Key is intergenerational learning.
16750,"Q5 How do different generations view #LifelongLearning - GenZ, Millenials, GenX, Baby Boomers?"
16751,"@SACAPGrad_CL And the best way to teach is to be the example. 
Model the behaviour
#lifelonglearning"
16752,Let‚Äôs chat about the generational approach. Q5 is coming up. #LifelongLearning
16753,"We have three more questions left. The responses to Q4 are very informative, because it is important that we teach the love for and interest in #LifelongLearning"
16754,A4.  By modelling the process.  Illustrating and applying the reference of #lifelonglearning to the material.  Encouraging and introducing options for ongoing learning into the programs and sessions #lifelonglearning https://t.co/mplc8CM5TB
16755,"A4 Coaching is about questioning and questions lead to growth, insight and therefor #lifelonglearning. As a coach I consider myself a vehicle for this process in all those I work with."
16756,"@SACAPGrad_CL A4 By co-creating new futures and endless possibilities, and unlocking potential with our clients, they acquire the means to co-create the same with others as long as they live #LifelongLearning"
16757,"A4 I think coaching is a practice in #lifelonglearning so just by being in the spaces we occupy we're adding to a culture of #lifelonglearning. I also think that as we learn &amp; share insights, as we encourage people to grow in confidence &amp; try new things we promote this culture."
16758,"@SACAPGrad_CL A4. By supporting clients to love questions and be comfortable not knowing, and how they can optimise that to create incredible spaces of learning and growth in their organisations. #LifelongLearning"
16759,"A4 #LifelongLearning is present at University of Manchester where I teach , we foster this by maintaining relationships with Alumni.Look for partnerships btw University and organisations"
16760,"@SACAPGrad_CL A4
Be naturally curious.
Share what you have learned.
Look in the mirror.... Do you use what's in your toolbox? 
Who do you hang out with and are they holding you accountable for your own
#lifelonglearning"
16761,"@SACAPGrad_CL Q4. By helping their clients examine their attitudes to learning, what helps and hinders their learning, and to explore what it means to be a learner.  Everything and everyone has the capacity to teach us something :-) #LifelongLearning"
16762,"By being open to learning themselves, keeping up to date with global best practices/trends, feedback from clients/markets and applying in practice in the work they do, discussions they have, and networks they are plugged into
#LifelongLearning https://t.co/FBXB8LkVDY"
16763,@Claire_Mindset Agree Claire that it is about a growth mindset #lifelonglearning
16764,"@SACAPGrad_CL A4. By modelling what it means to be a learner, being willing to be taught by their clients, being genuinely interested and recognising their clients brilliance. #LifelongLearning"
16765,A4#LifelongLearning is a mindset and a value. Check if it is embedded into the company‚Äôs policies and strategies and values .
16766,@Claire_Mindset #lifelonglearning https://t.co/6yD0wWVNGq
16767,Q4 How can coaches build a #LifelongLearning environment in the places where they work and teach?
16768,"@SACAPGrad_CL Yes, fully agree, and also how to work.  There is so much burnout and part of the learning is about the how and not just the what of working.  #LifelongLearning"
16769,"A3 Along with #lifelonglearning we need to be cultivating #growthmindset individuals, teams &amp; organisations. #Lifelonglearning goes hand in hand with #continuousimprovement and the willingness to regard mistakes as feedback rather than failure. This is where innovation happens."
16770,"Gearing up for Q4, keep the answers coming. Amazing to see how excited everyone is about #LifelongLearning"

#lifelonglearning"
16773,"A3.  The importance of Learning in organisations is vital as trends change, challenges change etc.  Change is inevitable and learning new skills adds value to the employees and the final offering to their client #lifelonglearning"
16774,"@SACAPGrad_CL A3. The workplace is moving away from career ladder to matrix or jungle gym. Giving up titles for skill sets.
We are working from future back... Not tweaking what worked yest
The way we always did it. Will no longer work.
What got us here.Won't get us there.
#lifelonglearning"
16775,@PaulaQuinsee I love your focus on the individual and the collective #lifelonglearning
16776,"A3 Our world is changing at an alarming rate - where we work, how we work and the kind of work we do are all changing. If we're not open to #lifelonglearning our skills will quickly become redundant. We used to say ""new normal"" now we know that ""new"" is normal!"
16777,People are also working for longer. #LifelongLearning is a way to address skills obsolescence
16778,@SACAPGrad_CL A3. For organisations to remain relevant and in business (!) the rate of learning needs to be higher than the rate of change. That requires everyone in the organisation to be a learner to ensure the longevity of the organisation. #LifelongLearning
16779,The pace of change is fast. #LifelongLearning addresses any potential skills gaps that may exist between formal education and on-the job requirements.
16780,"@SACAPGrad_CL A3. For organisations to retain employees it is important for them to create conditions where employees can flourish. Learning, growth and development opportunities are a key factor in creating those conditions. #LifelongLearning"
16781,It helps us to grow at an individual level but also collectively as a team/organisation and to achieve goals/vision we have put in place. #LifelongLearning https://t.co/F2ZpBpUs6r
16782,@SACAPGrad_CL A3 With the exponential rate of change #LifelongLearning is absolutely essential for organisations to keep on growing.
16783,@KarenLisaWhite @SACAPGrad_CL #LifelongLearning resilience is key.
16784,"A2 my commitment to #lifelonglearning generates excitement, inspiration and innovation in my work. This creates capacity for me personally and allows me to show up more fully professionally. Win win!"
16785,A3 #LifelongLearning is important as the ability to be agile and adaptable are crucial skills required to be competitive. New knowledge is required continually.
16786,A2.  The benefit for a Coach to have continuous learning as part of their personal strategy is that they too grow and intern are exposed to new practises and methodologies to benefit themselves and their offering to clients #lifelonglearning
16787,"We chatted about coaching, now we look at the workplace. Q3 Why is #LifelongLearning important in the workplace?"
16788,"We are going to move onto Q3, great input so far. #LifelongLearning"
16789,"We need to walk the talk, push our boundaries, remain relevant, find new ways to apply learnings, adapt to the changing needs of our clients. This means keeping abreast of new research, methodologies &amp; trends. Self development = added value to self &amp; others #lifelonglearning"
16790,"@SACAPGrad_CL A2. The intrinsic benefits include being resilient and living a fulfilling life. By lifelong learning we continuously grow, develop and learn about ourselves and what is important for us, as well as develop our capacity to meet the challenges in life. #LifelongLearning"
16791,A2 Benefits of #LifelongLearning for coaches are that coach offerings can exist outside predetermined programmes
16792,"@PaulaQuinsee @SACAPGrad_CL Q2. There are extrinsic and intrinsic benefits. The extrinsic ones are linked to matters such as making a living, remaining relevant and continuously up-skilling ourselves. #LifelongLearning"
16793,@SACAPGrad_CL A2 #LifelongLearning enables coaches to increase their self-awareness to deeper levels whcih will enable them to evoke deeper awareness from their clients. This is where magic happens and gold is found.

16804,We are gearing up for Q2. Getting some great feedback. Keep it coming. #LifelongLearning
16805,"A1.  In the times we are living in, in order to adapt and adjust to our circumstances, it is imperative that we are learners. #LifelongLearning #LifelongLearning"
16806,"@SACAPGrad_CL A1. Yes - we work with coachees for them to learn, grow and move and to acquire new direction, skills etc. To step out of comfort and negotiate fear to get to learning and growth. 
We need to apply the same to ourself as a coach. 
#lifelonglearning."
16807,"A1. Yes, life in general is a lifelong journey of learning but to remain relevant in an ever changing world, we constantly need to look at ways of up-skilling ourselves with new methodologies, research etc #LifelongLearning https://t.co/EbpwNxGL7G"
16808,Remember to use A1 when answering Q1 etc #LifelongLearning
16809,"A1 Coaching is a gift of profound personal learning &amp; development. If we expect our clients to be investing in this gift, we should be doing the same. We cannot guide others in their growth &amp; development if we're not committed to #LifelongLearning ourselves"
